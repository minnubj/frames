 <p>Introduction</p> 
<p>WhatsApp's popularity is in part due to it being completely free for consumers and substituting SMS and phone calls, both paid. That makes it great for keeping in touch with family and friends abroad. They only need a phone number to get started and the app is intuitive to use.</p>
<p>WhatsApp has a number of advanced security features. It has end-to-end encryption, just like Apple's iMessage and Signal. All messages flowing through the platform are secured so that only the sender and the recipient can view them. This means WhatsApp couldn't read your message even if it wanted to.</p>
