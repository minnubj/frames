<h2> <p>Introduction</p></h2>
<p>Twitter is a free social networking site where users broadcast short posts known as tweets. These tweets can contain text, videos, photos or links. To access Twitter, users need an internet connection or smart phone to use the app or website, Twitter.com.</p>
<p>Twitter was created by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams in March 2006 and launched in July of that year. [11][12][13] In 2013, it was one of the ten most-visited websites and has been described as "the SMS of the Internet".[14] By the start of 2019, Twitter had more than 330 million monthly active users.[15] In practice, the vast majority of tweets are tweeted by a minority of users.[16][17] In 2020, it was estimated that approximately 48 million accounts (15% of all accounts) were fake.[18]</p>
